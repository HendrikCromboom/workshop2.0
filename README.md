# Powershell: Time is the only limited resource in a lifetime

In this workshop we will tackle a couple of concepts that make Powershell as powerfull as it is, on of it's most prominent features is the automation of tasks and the management of assets. For webdevelopers the automation of tasks is probably the most noteworthy. While a devsecops/sysops team might provide you with a pleutera of tools in a larger company, those who work on a smaller scale often find they see room for automation everywhere.

By the end of this workshop you will have puppeteered over 4 languages/syntaxes: Powershell, C#, Assembly and .NET Forms. While this might seem absolutely daunting, keep in mind that I used the word puppeteered... The only language we will actualy be learning and using today is Powershell.
One of Powershells biggest strengths is that is can mandate a variety of actions and rules withing the Microsoft macrosystem (pun intended).

Without further ado let's orchestrate some mayhem:

### 1. Firmware

Before we begin let's make sure we are on the right version of Powershell (5+ should be sufficient). As you might have guessed we use powershell itself for this. Google is your friend.

### 2. Preparing for Take Off

Just like any terminal Powershell is commonly used to launch applications, let's launch Microsoft Calculator trough the Powershell Terminal shall we?

### 3. Houston We Have a Problem

Like any other developer we are of the opinion that typing anything ever at all twice is absolutely not done... So how about we create a script for this? 
The best way to get started with this is the official documentation, if we use the documentation we might even be able to skip the next section...

### 4. With great power comes great responsibility

Those who read the documentation know by now that Powershell is the most powerfull (scripting) tool in the universe... so powerfull even that it is banned (by your PC)...

We have 2 options here and the writer of this document is not at all responsible of you take the fast, easy and ultimately harmfull option 1:

Option 1: Find out how to enable all scripts on your PC, what could go wrong?

Option 2: Find out how to sign certain scripts or sign all scripts in a folder curated by you yourself. (Please pick this option...)

### 5. Speaking is beneath me...

It is finally time for the "coup de grace", we will be creating a small script that takes an input from the terminal or an UI and converts that to speach.

While we won't be reinventing cold water, the task seems more simple then it actually is. We wont be creating a program that translates text to speach, but it isn't a walk in the park either.

If you have any experience writing scripts I firmly encourage you to have a go at it, if not we will be discussing a couple of options as a group.

### 6. One small step for time saving, one big step for personal development

If somehow you did all of the above in 3 hours and this all is a bit beneath you how ab
